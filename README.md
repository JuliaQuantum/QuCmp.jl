# QuCmp
A JuliaQuantum package for simulations of quantum computers.

<!-- [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Roger-luo/Quantize.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Roger-luo/Quantize.jl)

Do not have a real quantum computer? Use **QuCmp** to quantize your computer!!! -->

# Motivation

As quantum computation implementation in experiments grows rapidly, a toolkit for bridging the gap between experimentalist and theorists could be necessary. To be specific, Translating quantum algorithm to quantum circuits or Hamiltonians in other models with a lower resource cost is important for both experimentalists and theorists.

This project will help scientists to design better architecture of quantum computers in real life.
